This repository contains slides and
[JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) exercises
for the workshop symposium [Computational Methods in Evolution and
Biodiversity](https://www.scilifelab.se/event/computational-methods-in-evolution-and-biodiversity/).
The exercises are hosted at
**<https://percyfal.github.io/workshop-biodiversity-summit>** and can
be run directly in your browser. If you have problems running the
notebooks in firefox, try [google
chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

The exercises are heavily based on material developed by [Yan
Wong](https://github.com/hyanwong) that can be found at
